Todo:
    refactor labelImg repository, mainly focus on io operations
    refactoring classes: LabelFile, LabelFileFormat, LabelIO

2022/10/30:
    In labelImg.py:
        add comments to note some code smells for refactory

    In labelImg.py, def save_labels():
        code smell:
            the function originally uses multiple if else statements to check the label format,
            and then call the corresponding method in LabelFile object to write the file

        solving:
            making a IOMAP(dictionary) in LabelFile.py
            whenever a label needs to be save, map the label format to the corresponding reader object
            so we have to allign the init method of all writers
            also the save() method in each writers
            for future extentions, writers must follow the format

        result:
            unit test passed

        futher work:
            add interface for writer that restrict the save() method and init() method
            (done)link labelformat with labelfile to remove dictionary mapping

2022/10/31:
    In labelImg.py, def set_format():
        code smell:
            using if else statements to set each format

        solving:
            making LabelFileFomat an abstract class, contain corresponding writer/reader(io), icon, text
            then implement the LabelFileFomat object with current available formats

            whenever the labelformat is specified, then the corresponding icon, text, io will be noticed,
            because the abstract class force the derived class to have the corresponding attributes,
            the only if-else statement remain is the toggle button

        result:
            unit test passed

        futher work:
            solve if-else in def change_format(), probably using a list, 
            or making a patch to search all derived class of LabelFileFormat

2022/11/6:
    In labelFile.py
        code smell:
            Extracting abstract class for labelFileFormat does not make sence.
            Ideally, abstract class provide a set of abstract method
            and concrete class must implement them.
            But for the fileformat design, we only need every format to own corresponding
            io as attribute. not method

        solving:
            thus, I redesign the labelFileFormat class as a concrete class
            Each format is a instance of this class, the init method force each instance to have
            the required attributes assigned

        result:
            unit test passed

        futher work:
            explore some design pattern to apply on format/io interfaces
