Todo:
    refactor file reader, file writer, labelfile class

2022/10/30 morning:
    In labelImg.py:
        add comments to note refactoring dependencies

2022/10/30 afternoon:
    In labelImg.py, def save_labels():
        code smell:
            the function originally uses multiple if else statements to check the label format,
            and then call the corresponding method in LabelFile object to write

        solving:
            making a IOMAP in LabelFile.py
            whenever a label needs to be save, map the label format to the corresponding reader object
            so we have to allign the init method of all writers
            also the save() method in each writers
            for future extentions, writers must follow the format

        result:
            unit test passed

        futher work:
            add interface for writer that restrict the save() method and init() method
